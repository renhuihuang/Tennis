As a tennis referee

I want to manage the score of a game of a set of a tennis match between 2 players with simple Game rules

In order to display the current Game score of each player

Rules details:

· The game starts with a score of 0 point for each player

· Each time a player win a point, the Game score changes as follow:

. 0 -> 15 -> 30 -> 40-> Win game

Rules details2:

· If the 2 players reach the score 40, the DEUCE rule is activated

· If the score is DEUCE , the player who win the point take the ADVANTAGE

· If the player who has the ADVANTAGE win the point, he win the game

· If the player who has the ADVANTAGE looses the point, the score is DEUCE

Les fichiers Deuce.java et Match.java représentent les deux cas possibles du jeu.

Les fichiers DeuceTest.java et MatchTest.java représentent les tests, certaines fonction présentent la fonction Random, ne sont donc pas testées.
